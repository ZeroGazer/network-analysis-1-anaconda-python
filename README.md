HKUST COMP4641 Social Information Network Analysis and Engineering (2015 Spring)
Assignment 0

========
The purpose of this assignment is to get you familiar with NetworkX and basic
concepts in network analysis. We choose ego-Facebook dataset as our testbase in
this assignment, since we are not going deep to detect social circles in this
assignment, you will only need to download the datafile
facebook_combined.txt.gz, which saves the list of all the edges in this graph.

For those of you who are interested in knowing what this dataset is about you
may check the "Dataset Information", "readme-Ego.txt", and the introduction of
the source paper: Learning to Discover Social Circles in Ego Networks. NIPS,
2012.

1. Number of nodes, Number of edges, Whether the network is connected or not?

2. Find out the id of node (or nodes) with maximum degree.

3. What is the clustering coefficient of the maximum degree node (or nodes) and
what is the average clustering coefficient of the whole network?

4. How many triangles in the network?

5. What is the shortest path from node 5 to node 3000?

6. What are the diameter and average shortest path length of the network?
